# Gh Pr Feedback

## Overview

Implement unaddressed PR feedback by reading the PR conversation and review threads, prioritizing the project owner's guidance, and delivering fixes via a stacked PR that targets the original PR branch.

## Workflow

### 1) Gather PR context

- Use `gh pr view <PR#> --json title,number,author,baseRefName,headRefName,headRepository,repository,reviewDecision` to capture branch names and repo.
- Use `gh pr view <PR#> --comments` and `gh pr view <PR#> --review-comments` to read the full comment thread.
- Use `gh pr view <PR#> --json reviews,comments,reviewThreads` if you need structured data for sorting or filtering.

### 2) Identify the project owner

- Determine the project owner from the repository owner (user/org) via `gh repo view --json owner`.
- Treat comments authored by that owner (or their designated maintainers if explicitly stated in the thread) as highest priority.

### 3) Build the feedback list

- Extract actionable items from review comments and top-level PR conversation comments.
- Mark items as **owner**, **non-owner**, and **owner-ignore**:
  - **owner**: authored by the project owner.
  - **owner-ignore**: any item the owner explicitly says to ignore/skip/leave as-is.
  - **non-owner**: all other reviewers.
- If the owner provides guidance on implementation details, follow that guidance even if it conflicts with other reviewer suggestions.

### 4) Check what is already addressed

- Compare feedback items against the current PR changes and comment follow-ups.
- Only implement items that are clearly unaddressed.
- If unclear, leave a brief note in the sub-PR description about the ambiguity.

### 5) Create a stacked sub-PR branch

- Create a new branch from the PR head branch (not from `main`):
  - `gh pr checkout <PR#>`
  - `git checkout -b pr-<PR#>-feedback`
- Implement the updates locally, following the owner's guidance for how to fix issues.
- Commit changes with a concise message that references the PR number.

### 6) Open a sub-PR targeting the original PR branch

- Push the branch and create a PR with the base set to the original PR head branch:
  - `git push -u origin pr-<PR#>-feedback`
  - `gh pr create --base <original-pr-head-branch> --head pr-<PR#>-feedback --title "PR <PR#> feedback fixes" --body "Addresses unaddressed review feedback from PR <PR#>. Prioritized owner comments; ignored items the owner said to skip."`
- If the repo uses stacked PR conventions (labels, prefixes, or templates), follow them.

### 7) Summarize and notify

- In the sub-PR description and/or a PR comment, summarize which feedback items were addressed and which were intentionally ignored due to owner instruction.
- If any feedback was deferred, state why and where it should be handled.

## Notes

- Never implement feedback the owner explicitly says to ignore.
- If the owner’s guidance is ambiguous, ask for clarification in the sub-PR or PR comment rather than guessing.
- Keep the sub-PR focused on feedback items only; avoid unrelated refactors.
