# Codex Skills

Personal collection of Codex skills I have created for my own projects. These are small, focused workflows and helpers I use to speed up common tasks and keep my prompts consistent.

## What’s in this repo

- **Independent skills**: Each folder contains a skill with its own `SKILL.md` instructions and any supporting assets, scripts, or references.
- **Reusable building blocks**: Skills are written to be reusable across projects, with a focus on clarity and repeatability.
- **Personal tooling**: This is my own toolbox; the structure and conventions reflect how I like to work.

## Contents

- `bedtimestories/` — Story-oriented skill(s) used for narrative tasks.
- `euler/` — Problem‑solving skill(s) for math/logic exercises.
- `github/` — GitHub workflow skill(s) for repo and PR automation.

## How I use these skills

1. I keep skills isolated so they’re easy to copy into other projects.
2. I document the intent and usage in `SKILL.md` so the workflow is reproducible.
3. I prefer small, composable skills over large, monolithic ones.
